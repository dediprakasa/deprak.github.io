Study of ideal gas was one of the center of attention in early days of statistical physics. All physical quantities of ideal gas can be obtained by knowing six parameters of molecules: three for position \\((x, y, z)\\) and three for velocity \\((v_x, v_y, v_z)\\). 

Maxwell focused only on velocity parameters since he wanted to study the thermal properties of ideal gas. The position parameters can be neglected because energy of a gas depends only on the velocities. Here, we only consider translational motion and neglect any rotational or vibrational motion. The energy of a molecule of ideal gas is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2_x + \frac{1}{2}mv^2_y + \frac{1}{2}mv^2_z = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

One significant insight that from this system is distribution of velocities at a given temperature. To know that, we need to define a **velocity distribution function** \\(f(\vec{v})\\) such that \\(f(\vec{v})d^3\vec{v}\\) shows the probability of finding particles with velocity \\(\vec{v}\\) between \\(\vec{v}+d^3\vec{v}\\). The velocity distribution is proportional to a Boltzmann factor

$$f(\vec{v}) \propto e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}}$$

where \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Hence, we also can write

$$f(\vec{v}) = Ce^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}}$$

Since \\(v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2\\), then

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(\vec{v})d^3\vec{v} &= Cexp\Big(-\frac{mv_x^2}{2kT} -\frac{mv_y^2}{2kT} -\frac{mv_z^2}{2kT}\Big) d^3\vec{v}
\\ 
&= C'exp\Big(-\frac{mv_x^2}{2kT}\Big)dv_x C'exp\Big(-\frac{mv_y^2}{2kT}\Big)dv_y C'exp\Big(-\frac{mv_z^2}{2kT}\Big)dv_z
\end{aligned}
$$

or we can write as

$$
f(\vec{v})d^3\vec{v}  = g(\vec{v_x})dv_x g(\vec{v_y})dv_y g(\vec{v_z})dv_z
$$

Now, let's evaluate the expected values for \\(x\\) component. We first need to normalize the function so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}{g(\vec{v_x})dv_x} &= 1
\\
C'\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}{exp\Big(-\frac{mv_x^2}{2kT}\Big)dv_x} &= 1
\\
C'\sqrt{\frac{2\pi kT}{m}} &= 1
\\
C' &=  \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}

\end{aligned}
$$



It is now possible to obtain the following quantities of this distribution

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{v_x} &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}v_xg(\vec{v_x})dv_x = 0
\\
\bar{v_x^2} &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}v_x^2g(\vec{v_x})dv_x = \frac{kT}{m}


\end{aligned}
$$
