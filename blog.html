                    <h2>My Firts Week in Hacktiv8: A Journey to Become a Fullstack Developer</h2>
                </div>
                <article>
                    <p>September 16th, 2019, a day where it all began, the kick-off of the coding bootcamp held by Hacktiv8. That day me and other participants
                        were briefed by the instructors about what we were going to face for the next 18s week: 6 weeks for preparation phase (Phase 0) and 12 weeks for the immersive phase (divided into Phase 1, 2, and 3).
                        The first week was still not really difficult as we only learned about the very fundamental of web development: HTML and CSS. In addition to that, we also
                        got introduced to git as version control system to manage the work that we were working on. What's new for me in this week was the experience of trully using github
                        as medium for collaboration. I previously have been using it for my personal project only. I worked with my other three friends to make simple e-commerce website using only HTML and CSS. While other group did the task by doing it together (physically), my team's
                        collaboration was fully relying on the use of github and Slack. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I am now really looking forward to going to the next week as I will dive into the realm of JavaScript.
