I am currently interested in mobile development. I have built some simple mobile apps to get myself used to being in this field. The projects are built using React Native.

#### **My Movies**

This app lets you create a list of movies and TV shows that you like or are going to watch. I implemented microservice architecture which separates the database of movies and TV shows (both are using MongoDB). Those two databases can be accessed through GraphQL API Gateway. The data of the movies and TV shows are retrieved from [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). Here is some preview of the app.

You can try this app by downloading Expo app in Google Store or App Store, then scan a barcode provided in this  link: [https://expo.io/@deprak/MyMovies](https://expo.io/@deprak/MyMovies "https://expo.io/@deprak/MyMovies")

Github repository:

#### **Mupis**

A less sophisticated version of the previous app. In this app, the user can only see movie and its detail. I did not build server for this app because all the data are obtained directly from [The Movie Database API.](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

Github repository:

#### **Bontiya**

This is actually a group project consisted of four members including me. My main role here was to build the user interface of the detail, form page, and to integrate the app with Google Visions API. As for now, I am unable to provide the live app for you to try it out. Nevertheless, I had recorded the flow of the app as you can see in the following video.

The presentation slides can be viewed [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UJcpD3H53MPVptVLzDa2QRPp99VlQADdcSF2l37oUrY/edit?usp=sharing)

Aside from my interest in mobile development, I am also working on sharpening my skills in web development. Below are some of the work I had done.
